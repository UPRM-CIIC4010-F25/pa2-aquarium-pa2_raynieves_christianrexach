# PA2: Aquarium

This project is a fun multi-directionaly iteractive evolution game . This repository is part of a Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course. The purpose of this project is to creatively help the student create practical programming skills by implementing changes to the base code that require strong understanding of the concepts discussed in class.

Base code developed by: Max R. Berrios Cruz

PS: Any blame or criticism is not to be put on the author, blame the staff instead.

Thank you and happy coding!

# Student Notes

Additions
1. Added Boundry Box, Intro music that leads into a looping section of the song, added docs folder under bin, added collision and/or collision effects (little red squares) for both npc-player collisions and npc-npc collisions
2. Created Goldfish, a power up that rarely spawn which will make you faster, speeding up the completion of the current level.
3. Created LionFish, a defbuff that slows down the player. The lionFish is immortal and can never be eaten. 
4. Added a Debuff visual Effect
5. Created a Dynamic Level system that gradually increases the amount of lionfishes, the main obstacle. 
6. Refactores Population Logic

Last minute aditional features:
1. Made Goldfish give an extra life (max 3)
2. Added dead fish sprite at game over
3. Completly redisigned how fish are spawned, which took way too much work, however it is all handled by level 0

Considerations
1. This project was made completly by myself (involuntarily i might add), even the little my partner did before withdrawing from the course had to be fixed by me later on
2. I spent the last 4 days of the proyect rushing to complete all of my partners parts in addition to mine whilst also taking 2 advanced math exams and completing 2 lab reports... i didnt sleep much...
